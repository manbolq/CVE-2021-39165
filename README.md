# CVE-2021-39165
Python3 POC for CVE-2021-39165 in CachetHQ


# Usage
First of all, you should install the dependencies:

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

If you want to check whether the victim URL is vulnerable or not, you can execute:

```bash
python3 exploit.py -u <URL> -c
```

If you want to know the output of a MySQL query, you can execute:

```bash
python3 exploit.py -u <URL> -q <QUERY>
```

**Note**: You should write a query whose output is a one-liner for the script to work properly :)

You can also check the help panel by typing:

```bash
python3 exploit.py -h
```
